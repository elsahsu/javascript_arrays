Q6-5:
Consider the following array.

var team = ["Oliver Wood", "Angelina Johnson", "Katie Bell", "Alicia Spinnet", "George Weasley", "Fred Weasley", "Harry Potter"];

Create a function called hasEnoughPlayers() that takes the team array as an argument and returns true or false depending on if the array has at least seven players.

Q6-8:
Use the array's forEach() method to loop over the following array and add 100 to each of the values if the value is divisible by 3.

var test = [12, 929, 11, 3, 199, 1000, 7, 1, 24, 37, 4, 19, 300, 3775, 299, 36, 209, 148, 169, 299, 6, 109, 20, 58, 139, 59, 3, 1, 139];

Q6-10:
Use a nested for loop to take the numbers array below and replace all of the values that are divisible by 2 (even numbers) with the string "even" and all other numbers with the string "odd".

var numbers = [
    [243, 12, 23, 12, 45, 45, 78, 66, 223, 3],
    [34, 2, 1, 553, 23, 4, 66, 23, 4, 55],
    [67, 56, 45, 553, 44, 55, 5, 428, 452, 3],
    [12, 31, 55, 445, 79, 44, 674, 224, 4, 21],
    [4, 2, 3, 52, 13, 51, 44, 1, 67, 5],
    [5, 65, 4, 5, 5, 6, 5, 43, 23, 4424],
    [74, 532, 6, 7, 35, 17, 89, 43, 43, 66],
    [53, 6, 89, 10, 23, 52, 111, 44, 109, 80],
    [67, 6, 53, 537, 2, 168, 16, 2, 1, 8],
    [76, 7, 9, 6, 3, 73, 77, 100, 56, 100]
];
